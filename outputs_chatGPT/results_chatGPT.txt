Prompt:
You will be given a piece of python code, many of which use tensorflow library. Your job is to find shape related errors if there are any. Only focus on errors that occur when the used shape does not match the expected shape in an operator or function. Ignore the errors related to redefine or fixed shape definitions. Generate outputs according to the templates: \"No shape mismatch found.\" if no shape errors found, or \"[error]: [LINENUMBER: LINEOFCODE] REASON\" if found any shape errors and make sure to provide reasons.
Model: gpt-4
gpt-4 is very flexible. even with temperature 0, it stills often generate different results
